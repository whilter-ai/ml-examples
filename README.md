# 🎯 Classical Machine Learning Approaches

Welcome to the **Classical ML Approaches** repository!  
This project is a curated collection of foundational machine learning methods that form the backbone of most AI systems today.

## 📚 What's Inside?

We dive into three essential ML techniques:

### 🔁 1. Regression  
Predict continuous values – like housing prices, stock trends, and more.  
Explore linear regression, polynomial regression, and regularization techniques like **Lasso & Ridge**.

### 🧠 2. Classification  
Classify data into categories – like spam detection, sentiment analysis, etc.  
Includes logistic regression, decision trees, KNN, SVMs, and more.

### 🔮 3. Prediction  
Forecast future outcomes using historical data.  
Time series analysis, trend modeling, and predictive algorithms included.
